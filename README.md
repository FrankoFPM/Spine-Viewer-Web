## Usage

To use the application, you need to have spine files in .skel format, which are generated by Spine when exporting the animations. You can get these files from different sources, such as games, tutorials or free resources.

To load a spine file, click on the "Upload asset" button and select the files of the spine you want to see, then on the "GO" button. The application will display the spine in the visualization window, and you can control the animation with the side controls. You can also change the background of the player with the "Background" button, you can choose a color or your own image.

This project aims to visualize sprites. In particular, it focuses on the sprites of the game Azur Lane, owned by Yostar. This repository does not contain any asset of the game, and each user must provide their own. This application has no commercial purposes, and only intends to be a visualization and learning tool.

> [!NOTE]
> You must select the 3 files of the sprite, they must have the same name
> The extensions for the 3 files must be `.atlas`, `.skel` and `.png`
